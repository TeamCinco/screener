# screener

# May Delete /  become deprecated. 
- Another private repo may replace this. This script tries to act as a screener for over 9k stocks on an excel.....
- That is wrong because its impossible to read that.

- This script basically tries to do too much..... It tries to adaptivley weight vairaibles that provide a finaly buy, avoid, hold, sell signal but it is all wrong.....
- The real answer is analyzing the statistical properties of the returns of an asset and generating a strategy from that.
